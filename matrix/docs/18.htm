        I mean we’ve tempered with the experiment, right? By getting into close contact with the colony,  introducing ourselves. It's not really even valid anymore. I know it was my own damn stupid fault, but Zeeso is the one who took it way too far. And now can I really say that the results we’re getting are good? I’m just so tired.
