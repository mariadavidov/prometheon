        This is going to be the most important mission of my life. Hell, it might prove to be one of the most important experiments in human history. Artificial biomechanical organisms are already a wonder on their own, but with a culture? Mythology? Society? It would… God, it would mean so much!

        I am honored to have been chosen to head the research team. Scared too. Really, really scared. At least Zeeso is trying to be nice. But this is too important for me to fuck up.
