        The colony has been exposed to our research. They now know of the nature of our experiment and have acquired an unprecedented amount of Iridium. It proved to be, as we suspected, an exceptional fuel to their bodies. But the massive consumption has created a chemical reaction that released an unprecedented amount of an unknown gas we are trying to study. Upon questioning, Doctor Pand has admitted to allying herself with the Ludi and providing them with the Iridium. We will commence her trial in two days. In the meantime, she has been stripped of all duties and awaits her trial in the prison cells. After, I will determine whether or not the experiment should be terminated.

    <br/> <br/>
    Signed, Doctor Zeeso Herm, Head of Contact
