        The sick soldiers are experiencing poisoning from the Iridium. Their symptoms shouldn’t be so severe, it must be from the chemical reaction created from the contact with the Ludi. Worse, the poisoning seems to be airborne. An intern who wasn’t with the team on Prometheon-1 has started to cough and sweat. I have initiated evacuation protocols, but without the communication wavelength there is only so much we can do.

    Elea Pand has been banished to Prometheon-1.
