        So Eleandron is apparently a monthly feast thing. How fun. Zeeso thought it would be “productive for the experiment” if I was to attend. What a fucking prick.
        <br/> <br/>
        It was honestly depressing. They did so much work. Food, drinks, clothes. Songs and dances. They made me a throne, and I had to sit on it and look down as they presented whatever they managed to find as offerings. They did all of that, and for what? 
        <br/> <br/>
        How am I a god, I can’t even cook my breakfast without burning it.
<br/> <br/>
I never want to do that ever again. Something tells me Zeeso will not allow that.
