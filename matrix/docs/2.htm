    <p>
        Day 14 of the Ludi Experiment - the colony has adjusted to the atmosphere and local flora well. There have been minor casualties with the local fauna, but nothing that would endanger our experiment. We have initiated our first exposure to the artificial culture. We shall monitor the development, but so far it seems that our initial assumptions will be proven correct. I have reported the satisfactory progression to the company headboard.
