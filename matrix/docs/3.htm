    <p>
        Day 861 of the Ludi Experiment - the colony has fully integrated with the artificial culture we have created - they have created various customs, traditions, and even stories surrounding the artificial signs we’ve created on the planet. Moreover, after Doctor Pand’s accidental exposure to the colony, the Ludi have started to believe her to be a god and have even begun a monthly celebration in her honor. Consequently, they started to believe that the planet serving as our headquarters is home to more gods like Doctor Pand. I find it all terribly ironic. Nonetheless, the Experiment is now ready to progress to Phase 3. A report has been sent to the company headboard.
