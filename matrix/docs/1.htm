        Day 1 of the Ludi Experiment - the colony has been established on Prometheon-1. We ourselves have landed on New Terra successfully. So far things have progressed as expected - the colony is set to awaken in two days, and after the rehabilitation process we will move into Phase 2.

    <br/> <br/>
    Planet Temperature: 26.3C
 
    <br/> Colony Count: 10,432<br/> Abnormalities: 0 <br/> <br/>
