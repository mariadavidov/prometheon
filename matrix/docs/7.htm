        Communication channels are still down. We have sent a team down to Prometheon-1 to deal with some of the unruly Ludi and bring probes of the Iridium gas, with casualties mostly on the Ludi side. But the soldiers who have returned are weak and sickly. Our medics are trying to figure out what’s wrong. I will personally supervise the Iridium investigation.
