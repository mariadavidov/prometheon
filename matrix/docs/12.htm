        We have only just begun Phase 2 and already there are so many new findings! The Ludi are adjusting remarkably well! They’re responding to our planted signs so fucking quickly - just yesterday, one of them found the markings we have planted and they already think there are some sort of ancient powers there! That is so ridiculously human of them. It’s so hard to remember they were created in a lab sometimes.

        I think I’ll keep recording my thoughts like this. I like it. It would be really funny to look back at these in a few years and see how wrong I was in my predictions. Here’s one - the Ludi are going to make up some sort of wild sex god. Prove that wrong, future Elea.
