        I’m as bad as Zeeso. FUCK! I really shouldn’t have gone to Prometheon-1 on my own. I really don’t know why I did it. I just… walked through one of the settlements, the one Zeeso decided to destroy as “punishment from the gods”. They can’t cry, the Ludi, but they looked so… defeated. So accepting of their fate because they must’ve done something wrong, right? And then they saw me, and they all flocked at me like hungry animals, offering me everything, anything they could find. Just so that a mighty god might forgive them for their invisible sins.
