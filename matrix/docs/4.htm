        Day 3041 - Phase 3 is progressing exceptionally well. The colony has completely immersed themselves in the artificial culture, and has developed an entire mythology around it, as well as around the existence of New Terra, Doctor Pand, and the rest of the research team. Any disastrous event - be it natural or of our creation - is considered punishment from the gods, and new customs emerge to satisfy our “temper”. We cycle between appeasing and punishing the colony, and so far they have acted the way primitive human cultures have done on earth. The resemblance between them and ancient cultures like the Greeks and Romans is exceptional, despite the biomechanical nature of the Ludi. We are making astounding progress in Artificial Organism Studies.
